# skyralchemy
A web app for optimizing alchemy ingredients' usage in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim

Created for use on a phone or tablet (so users don't have to alt+tab in and out of game)

The app is intended to order the potions by most valuable (ergo, giving the most experience when created) and show what ingredients are required for that potion.

If you don't have an ingredient, tap its name and it will move to the "Unavailable Ingredients" list (which can be hidden if it gets too long), 
removing that ingredient from any other potions' ingredients list as well.

TO-DO: Find reliable data on potion values bc official wiki is not accurate

TO-DO: Account for multiple effects in one potion (for example, Blue Mtn Flower + Blue Butterfly Wing have two effects in common).
